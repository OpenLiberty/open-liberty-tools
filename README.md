2. Start your Eclipse workbench.
3. Start the installation using either of the following methods.
    Locate the installation files from your Eclipse workbench:
        Click Help > Eclipse Marketplace.
        In the Find field, type WebSphere.
        In the list of results, locate IBM WebSphere Application Server Liberty Developer Tools for Oxygen (and later) and then click Install. The Confirm Selected Features page opens.
    Drag an Install icon from a web page to your Eclipse workbench:
        Open your web browser to http://www.ibm.com/wasdev and click the Download tab.
        Select WebSphere Developer Tools for Eclipse Oxygen (and later) from the asset list.
        Locate the Install icon for WebSphere Application Server Liberty. 
        Select and drag the Install icon to your Eclipse workbench, and drop it on the Eclipse toolbar. The Confirm Selected Features page opens.
    On the Confirm Selected Features page, expand the parent nodes and select the WebSphere Application Server  Liberty Tools feature and the WebSphere Application Server  Liberty Docker Tools feature. When you are finished, click Next.
4. On the Review Licenses page, review the license text. If you agree to the terms, click I accept the terms of the license agreement and then click Finish. The installation process starts.
    
  Note
    During the installation, a Security Warning dialog box might open and display the following message:
    Warning: You are installing software that contains unsigned content. The authenticity or validity of this software cannot   be established. Do you want to continue with the installation?
You can safely ignore the message and click 'install anyway' to continue.
5. When the installation process completes, restart the workbench.
